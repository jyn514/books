Proposition: statement that must be either true or false
ex: For every nonnegative integer n the value of n^2 + n + 41 is prime. (false)

# less strict definitions
Theorem: Important proposition proven true
Lemma: Preliminary proposition proven true
Corrollary: Proposition which follows easily from theorem

Axiomatic method
    Start from as few axioms as possible and derive the rest
    Proofs are series of logical deductions
    Classic example is Euclidian geometry
    Must state ahead of time which theorems are assumed
    
Deductions
                      antecedents         consequent
    modus podens - if a implies b and a . b.
    transitive property - if a implies b and b implies c. a implies c
    contraposition - if ¬a implies ¬b, b implies a.
    
Types of proofs
    
    Implication: If a, then b
        Assume a. Show why b follows.
    
    Prove the contrapositive: if not(b), then not(a)
        Assume ¬b. Show why ¬a follows.
    
    If and only if: logically equivalent
        Show a implies b
        Show b implies a
        
    Proof by cases:
        Break problem into cases. Prove each seperately.
        
    Proof by contradiction:
        Assume the opposite. Show a logical contradiction.
        
Errors:
    Circular reasoning
    Unjustified conclusions
    Leave proofs 'to the reader'
